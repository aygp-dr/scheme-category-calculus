Context: Development Environment Setup
=======================================

Timing: 2025-08-06, ~5 minutes implementation

Purpose:
- Set up integrated Scheme development environment
- Enable REPL-driven development workflow
- Support literate programming with org-mode

Implementation Considerations:
- Used .envrc for environment variables (direnv compatible)
- Configured Emacs with Geiser for Guile Scheme integration
- Added tmux session management for persistent development sessions
- Included Paredit for structural editing of S-expressions
- Enabled org-babel for literate programming support

Technical Choices:
- Guile 3 as the primary Scheme implementation
- Geiser for interactive REPL and debugging
- Paredit for balanced parenthesis editing
- TRAMP support for potential remote development
- Project-specific Emacs configuration isolated from global config

Makefile Targets Added:
- make dev: Start tmux session with configured Emacs
- make dev-attach: Reconnect to existing session
- make dev-stop: Terminate development session
- make dev-status: Check session status and TTY

Known Issues:
- Emacs packages will auto-install on first run (may take time)
- Requires tmux and emacs to be installed system-wide
- Geiser needs guile3 binary in PATH

Future Enhancements:
- Add support for multiple tmux windows/panes
- Include debugger configuration
- Add project-specific snippets
- Configure automatic code formatting
