Implementation notes for category theory examples:

Thought process:
1. Started by examining the existing structure - found only a dependency check script
2. Created 6 progressive examples to demonstrate core concepts
3. Each example builds on previous concepts while remaining self-contained
4. Focused on computational verification of mathematical laws

Debugging/Issues encountered:
- Initial shebang issue with check.scm - Guile was parsing #\!/usr/bin/env incorrectly
- Fixed by removing shebang and calling guile3 directly
- Intentionally left one non-commutative diagram example to show failure cases
- All examples include verification code to demonstrate correctness

Technical decisions:
- Used SRFI-9 records for type safety
- Pattern matching with (ice-9 match) for clarity
- Kept examples minimal but complete
- Added visual output to make abstract concepts concrete

Future improvements:
- Add more advanced category theory concepts (limits, colimits, topoi)
- Implement visualization for diagram commutation
- Create a proper module system for reusable components
- Add property-based testing for law verification
